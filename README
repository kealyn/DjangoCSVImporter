Overview
--------
A python program that allows developers to import CSV files and map their data to models,
mapping column headers to model fields in the data migration section downwards.


Steps to import CSV data into django
------------------------------------
*Note that these steps are for general purpose, the portable package should only contain
csvImporter.py. But to make everything running and complete, I also include all the 
needed projects, apps in this package, thus no further steps should be carried out.
1. Create the django model for the data schema, including possibly a project and an app.
Instructions can be found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/
2. Put the CSV file and ¡°csvImporter.py¡± script in the same directory and change the
name accordingly in "csvImporter.py".
3. Run the command "python csvImporter.py" to do the loading job.

Note that some settings are based on the file structure, make sure you have the right
file name if you make any changes. All the modifications should be made accordingly in
corresponding py files.
